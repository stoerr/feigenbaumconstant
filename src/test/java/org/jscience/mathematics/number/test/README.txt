This is a preliminary version of my testsuite for the org.jscience.mathematics.number
classes. I need some feedback whether it is OK that way before I continue, since 
major changes become more and more painful the more code there is. In my view, these
tests are ready to be included, except that they are not yet complete.

To run the tests successfully you need to fix the bugs I reported. Fixes are included
into the bug reports.

I suggest to put the tests into a separate source folder /test - they do certainly 
not belong into jscience.jar.

Before actually including anything please contact me, since I'll probably have more 
tests ready.

Thanks!
